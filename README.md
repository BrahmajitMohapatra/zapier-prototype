# Zapier Prototype

This project is a prototype for integrating Zapier with custom triggers and actions. It allows users to trigger actions via webhooks and perform operations such as sending Solana tokens or sending an email.

## Features

- **Webhook Trigger**: The system listens for webhook events and uses these as triggers.
- **Solana Transfer Action**: Based on the webhook trigger, Solana tokens can be sent to a specified wallet address.
- **Email Action**: Alternatively, the system can send an email to a recipient based on the webhook trigger.

## System Design

The overall architecture and workflow for this system can be viewed in the system design flowchart below:
